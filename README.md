## What we are building
 
Everyday, hundreds of waste materials are piling up in Sri Lankan households. Some burn them (causing major environmental damage), some leave them as it is. But this issue can be resolved with the collaboration of waste producers and recyclers. Also, there are many individuals who are willing to reuse the items used by others, if it's in reasonable condition. We are building a platform to meet this 3 parties, enabling to buy and sell waste items,
